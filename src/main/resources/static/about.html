        <h2>EasyLink</h2>
        <p>This application allows you to shorten your links and name them by specified Id. Firstly
            To run the program successfully it is necessary to have MySQL database server installed on your machine.
            Database Username must be set to: "root" and password must be set to "abcd1234".
            User interface can be found entering <a href="http://localhost:8080/">"http://localhost:8080/"</a> in your Web Browser address bar.</p>
        <h2>Home page</h2>
        <p>Now you can see two input fields *Long URL* and *Short URL*.
            In *Long URL* paste link that must be 'shortened'. In *Short URL*(maximum 1000 symbols) enter name to which *Long URL* will be redirected.
            After filling both fields press button Shorten. And voila! Now you can access to your inappropriately humongous link through following
            address : "http://localhost:8080/links/*Short URL*".
        </p>
        <p>Few words about our frugal navigation bar.</p>

        <p> Home button always returns you to homepage, whenever you are.</p>

        <p>About button as you already see is our web page documentation.</p>

        <p> !!!MY LISTS!!! button place after registration you will see your accounts list of shortened links.</p>

        <p> Logically, Register button opens registration form. There you must enter your account name/nickname(maximum 100 symbols),
            Email(maximum 100 symbols), Password(maximum 100 symbols & password must contain at least one uppercase symbol, lowercase symbol and number) + re-enter it.</p>

            This is web controller for our application. It handles HTTP requests. If you enter "http://localhost:8080/links/" in Web Browser address bar,
            you will see what currently database stores.
            Example:    (JSON)
            {
            ..
            {
            "id": name for link given by user,
            "full_url": links full address,
            },
            ..
            }
            For our API, you can try tool, such as the Firefox RESTClient, or Chrome's POSTMAN to test the REST integration.
            Using them you can check mapping for HTTP GET requests, add new urls in database with HTTP POST, or DELETE some records from database.
            To GET, POST or DELETE something you must choose in corresponded request method in REST integration testing tool
            and enter following address "http://localhost:8080/links/{id}" where {id} is needed links name.
